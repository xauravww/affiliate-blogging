In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission made new rules. These rules help people know if the person creating content online is getting money or support from another company. Readers need to know if the person is making money by promoting a product or link.
So, please think about the following for this site:
All the links on this site are special types of links. I earn a small amount of money when certain items are sold through these links.
What are these special links? They are links to other company websites where you can buy things. When a reader clicks on a link on this site to buy an item, they buy it directly from the seller, not from me. Companies like Amazon give me a small payment for helping to bring customers to their website.
Prices are the same for readers whether they buy through a special link or a regular link. Clicking a special link or a regular link doesn’t change the price or anything else for the visitor.
I use two main types of these special links:
Amazon links. This site is part of the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program. This is a program that helps website owners earn money by linking to Amazon and affiliated sites, and also to other websites that may be part of Amazon Service LLC Associates Program.
Product links. If you click a product link and buy the product, then I get a part of the sale or some other type of payment. Prices are not different if you use these special links. You won’t pay more by clicking the link. These links don’t work on a “pay per click” system.
What about sponsored content? I don't write sponsored posts. I want to give real, straightforward information. But, if a company wants to publish sponsored content on my site, I will make this clear at the start of the post.
The main point is that I only recommend products I use myself or that I would recommend to family and friends. Your purchase helps me continue my research work. Thank you very much! I appreciate you!
